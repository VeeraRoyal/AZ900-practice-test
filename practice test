Question 3 of 50
What are two characteristics of a consumption-based model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Your Answer
no upfront costs
This answer is correct.
the ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
This answer is correct.
Correct Answer
no upfront costs
This answer is correct.
the ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
This answer is correct.
In a consumption-based model, you do not pay for anything until you start using resources, and you only pay for what you use. If you stop using a resource, you stop paying for it. High expenditures are usually associated with the purchase of the physical infrastructure, which is not needed in a consumption-based model.

Question 4 of 50
Why is cloud computing often less expensive than on-premises datacenters? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Your Answer
Network bandwidth is free.
This answer is incorrect.
Correct Answer
You are only billed for what you use.
This answer is correct.
Renting compute and storage services and being billed for only what you use often lowers operating expenses. Depending on the service and the type of network bandwidth, charges can be incurred. Cloud service offerings often provide functionality that can be difficult or cost-prohibitive to deploy on-premises, especially for smaller organizations. Major cloud providers offer services around the world. Making it easy and relatively inexpensive to deploy services close to where your users reside.

Question 13 of 50
Your organization is building a custom application.

You need to focus on application development rather than configuration and management of servers.

Which cloud service model should you use?

Your Answer
infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
This answer is incorrect.
Correct Answer
platform as a service (PaaS)
This answer is correct.
With PaaS, users can focus on application development because the cloud provider handles all the platform management. In SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.

Correct Answer
associating costs with different environments
This answer is correct.
categorizing costs by department
This answer is correct.
You can use tags to categorize costs by department, such as human resources, marketing, or finance, or by environment, such as test or production. Resizing underutilized virtual machines is a good cost saving measure and provisioning resources in lower cost regions is a good practice, but resource tags do not help with this.
